# Core libraries used in RAG implementation

langchain                 # Framework for building LLM-powered applications
faiss-cpu                 # Vector store for fast similarity search (CPU version)
pymupdf                   # For reading and parsing PDF documents
transformers              # HuggingFace Transformers for embeddings and LLMs
sentence-transformers     # Easy-to-use wrapper for sentence-level embeddings

# Optional (used if you're using OpenAI's models)
openai                    # To access OpenAI's GPT models via API

# Model Note:
# Zephyr model is used as the LLM in this project for generating natural responses.
